git för att starta en github repo, follow the instructions in the hj repo that we made.
to continue on an old repo clone it 

to clone the repo you need to do git clone then the ssh url.


it will error out if you dont have an ssh key made. to get one you will need to do 4 steps
1 install ssh
2 run the ssh-keygen command
3 navigate to your profile -> settings -> ssh & gpg keys
then add the id_ed25519.pup key into the text field

For networking principals https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bj-Yfakjllc&list=PLIFyRwBY_4bRLmKfP1KnZA6rZbRHtxmXi

i recommend using WSL 
to do this you will need to enable vt-x and vt-d in bios
look up how to do this for your motherboard. it can be hard
